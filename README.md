## ðŸš€ Quick Start - Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- pip package manager

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/dakota/rivercity
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   ./serve-mkdocs.sh
   ```

   **Alternative (if script has issues):**
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

### Access the Site

Once running, the documentation site will be available at:
- **http://127.0.0.1:8000** or **http://localhost:8000**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Script Execution Issues
If you get `cannot execute: required file not found` when running `./serve-mkdocs.sh`:

```bash
# Fix line endings (Windows CRLF to Unix LF)
sed -i 's/\r$//' serve-mkdocs.sh
```

### Virtual Environment Issues
If the script warns about virtual environment not being detected:

```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is properly activated
source .venv/bin/activate
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV  # Should show the venv path
```

### Manual Server Start
If the script continues to have issues:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run MkDocs directly
mkdocs serve --dev-addr=127.0.0.1:8000
